# Open Digital Twin Platform

The Open Digital Twin Platform (ODTP) is a joint effort of the Center for Sustainable Future Mobility (CSFM) and the Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC) to enable the automated generation and sharing of arbitrary Digital Twins.

Our first prototype will be on mobility simulations making MATSim simulations easily accessible through a Digital Twin. The prototype is expected to be publicly available this Autumn. In case you are interested in ODTP, please contact Jascha Gr√ºbel.

## Funding

ODTP is currently funded by a Swiss Open Research Data Grant administrated by swissuniversities (Grant ODTPR-SMS).
